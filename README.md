# application-of-convolutional-neural-network-for-disease-detection-alzheimer
This repository contains a Python application for Alzheimer's disease prediction using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The application provides a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter, allowing users to load datasets of healthy individuals and those with Alzheimer's disease, as well as a test dataset for evaluation. The CNN model is trained on the provided datasets, and predictions are displayed with corresponding test results.
